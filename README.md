# Description
This is an analysis of the Boston housing dataset originally published in Harrison and Rubinfield (1978), performed in Python. The exploration is based off of one of the assessment tasks in the IBM Python and SQL for Data Science course.

The task questions can be found in the Python script. It largely concerns statistical tests for correlation and the analysis is backed by distribution/scatterplot visualisations that can be found in the Tableau file.
