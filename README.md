# Description
This is an analysis of the Boston housing dataset originally published in Harrison and Rubinfield (1978), performed in Python. The exploration is based off of one of the assessment tasks in the IBM Python and SQL for Data Science course.

The task questions can be found below, or in the Python script. It largely concerns statistical tests for correlation and the analysis is backed by distribution/scatterplot visualisations that can be found in the Tableau file.

**Tools used:**
- **Python; scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, statmodels.api**
- **Tableau**

# Task

- Is there a significant difference in the median value of houses bounded by the Charles river or not? (CHAS ~ MEDV)
- Is there a difference in median values of houses of each proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940? (AGE ~ MEDV)
- Can we conclude that there is no relationship between Nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town? (INDUS ~ NOX)
- What is the impact of an additional weighted distance to the five Boston employment centres on the median value of owner-occupied homes? (DIS ~ MEDV)
